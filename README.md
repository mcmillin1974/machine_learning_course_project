#Coursera Data Science Course - Machine Learning Course Project

####Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

####Project Objective
The goal of this project is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm and dumbbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which they did the exercise (indicated by the "classe" variable in the training dataset).

####Data Source
The data for this project was provided by:
